# ECE490-491_CAPSTONE
Capstone project for my EE degree 
Designed and built an IoT Ultraviolet (UV) fire sensing device to identify and extinguish wildfire entering a community, using LoRaWAN protocol 
Designed both the sensor units  (a Sprinkler unit and a UV sensor unit), designed a UV wave guide to increase range of sensor.
We used a RAK3272s for the LoRa Communication, and an STM32 board for the control side of things. 


You can find the schematics below and pics of it working.
Enjoy!!!
